# LEETCODE-Strings-131
Sure, let's go through a dry run of the `partition` method in the `Solution` class using the input string `s = "aab"`.

### Step-by-step Execution

#### Initial Call
1. `partition("aab")` is called.
2. `ans` is initialized as an empty list: `ans = []`.
3. `dfs("aab", 0, [], ans)` is called.

#### First Call to `dfs`
- `start = 0`
- `path = []`
- We enter the for loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `2` (inclusive).

##### First Iteration (`i = 0`)
4. Check if `s.substring(0, 1)` (i.e., "a") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 0, 0)` returns `true`.
5. Add "a" to `path`: `path = ["a"]`.
6. Call `dfs("aab", 1, ["a"], ans)`.

#### Second Call to `dfs`
- `start = 1`
- `path = ["a"]`
- We enter the for loop with `i` ranging from `1` to `2` (inclusive).

##### First Iteration (`i = 1`)
7. Check if `s.substring(1, 2)` (i.e., "a") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 1, 1)` returns `true`.
8. Add "a" to `path`: `path = ["a", "a"]`.
9. Call `dfs("aab", 2, ["a", "a"], ans)`.

#### Third Call to `dfs`
- `start = 2`
- `path = ["a", "a"]`
- We enter the for loop with `i` ranging from `2` to `2` (inclusive).

##### First Iteration (`i = 2`)
10. Check if `s.substring(2, 3)` (i.e., "b") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 2, 2)` returns `true`.
11. Add "b" to `path`: `path = ["a", "a", "b"]`.
12. Call `dfs("aab", 3, ["a", "a", "b"], ans)`.

#### Fourth Call to `dfs`
- `start = 3`
- `path = ["a", "a", "b"]`
- Since `start` is equal to `s.length()`, we add `path` to `ans`: `ans = [["a", "a", "b"]]`.
- Backtrack by removing the last element from `path`: `path = ["a", "a"]`.

##### Back to Third Call
- We have completed the iterations in the for loop (since `i` only ranges up to `2`).
- Backtrack by removing the last element from `path`: `path = ["a"]`.

##### Back to Second Call
##### Second Iteration (`i = 2`)
13. Check if `s.substring(1, 3)` (i.e., "ab") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 1, 2)` returns `false`.

##### Back to Second Call
- We have completed the iterations in the for loop (since `i` only ranges up to `2`).
- Backtrack by removing the last element from `path`: `path = []`.

##### Back to First Call
##### Second Iteration (`i = 1`)
14. Check if `s.substring(0, 2)` (i.e., "aa") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 0, 1)` returns `true`.
15. Add "aa" to `path`: `path = ["aa"]`.
16. Call `dfs("aab", 2, ["aa"], ans)`.

#### Fifth Call to `dfs`
- `start = 2`
- `path = ["aa"]`
- We enter the for loop with `i` ranging from `2` to `2` (inclusive).

##### First Iteration (`i = 2`)
17. Check if `s.substring(2, 3)` (i.e., "b") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 2, 2)` returns `true`.
18. Add "b" to `path`: `path = ["aa", "b"]`.
19. Call `dfs("aab", 3, ["aa", "b"], ans)`.

#### Sixth Call to `dfs`
- `start = 3`
- `path = ["aa", "b"]`
- Since `start` is equal to `s.length()`, we add `path` to `ans`: `ans = [["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]`.
- Backtrack by removing the last element from `path`: `path = ["aa"]`.

##### Back to Fifth Call
- We have completed the iterations in the for loop (since `i` only ranges up to `2`).
- Backtrack by removing the last element from `path`: `path = []`.

##### Back to First Call
##### Third Iteration (`i = 2`)
20. Check if `s.substring(0, 3)` (i.e., "aab") is a palindrome: `isPalindrome("aab", 0, 2)` returns `false`.

##### Back to First Call
- We have completed the iterations in the for loop (since `i` only ranges up to `2`).

### Final Result
21. Return `ans`: `ans = [["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]`.

The final output is:
```java
[["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]]
```
